HI THERE I'M GEORGE 

After taking a huge leap from the career I knew in hospitality, I have since taken my love for problem-solving to web development, where I completed a number of solo and team-based projects, which have developed into a real love of building accessible applications.


  
-  First year in the world of development complete 
- 🌱 I have officially graduated  The School Of Code!!
- 💞️ Currently learning Drupal and building a community recipe app for my locals in the area.
- 📫 How to reach me ... georgegordon5@gmail.com
